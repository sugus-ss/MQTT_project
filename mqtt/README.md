- **Client**: Client can read sensor data stored in an Excel file and sends to Broker.
- **Broker**: Broker forwards any data it receives to its subscribers using Mosquitto and Paho
- **Server**: Subscribes for data from Client and save into SQLite

- **SampleInput.xlsx:**  
An example of a file for receiving and sending data.
